In a single-spa world, your SPA contains many registered applications, where each has its own framework. Registered applications have their own client-side routing and their own frameworks/libraries. They render their own HTML and have full freedom to do whatever they want, whenever they are *mounted*. The concept of being *mounted* refers to whether a registered application is putting content on the DOM or not. What determines if a registered application is mounted is its [activity function](configuration#activity-function). Whenever a registered application is *not mounted*, it should remain completely dormant until mounted.","source":"@site/versioned_docs/version-4.x/building-applications.md","permalink":"/docs/4.x/building-applications","editUrl":"https://github.com/single-spa/ru.single-spa.js.org/blob/master/website/versioned_docs/version-4.x/building-applications.md","version":"4.x","sidebar_label":"single-spa applications","sidebar":"version-4.x/docs","previous":{"title":"Configuring single-spa","permalink":"/docs/4.x/configuration"},"next":{"title":"Splitting up applications","permalink":"/docs/4.x/separating-applications"}}')}}]);
